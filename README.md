# LithiumCompiler
 A compiler that compiles the Lithium language to assembly source code, currently only working for linux. Windows support is available but not fully so it's currently disabled from the source code.

 Lithium Features:
- Syntax that is similar to C but also simpler.
- Easy to learn language for both experienced and new programmers.
- Can be compiled for multiple platforms.

  These are all features that Litihum already has or will have once it's fully completed.
  For now it's just a simple language with no real function but it's not very far away from completion.
