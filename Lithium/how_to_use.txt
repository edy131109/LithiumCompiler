This is a compiler for my language called LithiumScript

To compile the test example script found in ../test.l you can run the command
g++ -std=c++2a src/main.cpp -o build/L; ./build/L ../test.l linux; ./out; echo $?
in the linux terminal

The number shown in the console is the output given by the program (exit code).
