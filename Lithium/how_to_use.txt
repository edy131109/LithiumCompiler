This is a compiler for my language called LithiumScript

To compile the test example script found in ../test.l you can run the command
g++ -std=c++2a src/main.cpp -o build/LS; ./build/LS.exe ../test.l win; ./out.exe; echo $LastExitCode
in the windows powershell

The number shown in the console is the output given by the program.
